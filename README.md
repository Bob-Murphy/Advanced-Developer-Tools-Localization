**If you're interested in contributing a translation, please follow these steps:**
 1. Take a look in the issues section, and **make sure no one else has "claimed" the localization** for your language (see step 2)
 2. Create a new issue with the name: `Feature Request: <Language Name> localization`. This tells me and the others that you want to claim this language as well. So others won't work and there won't be a conflict.
 3. Download the file to your computer.
 4. Search for your language name and translate the phrase next to it according to the `Original` translation. For example, if you want to localize for German, search for `<German>` and translate all the phrases.
 5. Once you're done, create a fork of this repository, upload the updated `Stringtable.xml` on your forked repository, and make a pull request.

**Note 1:** Please make sure you only modify 1 language in a single pull request. If you want to contribute to multiple languages, please follow the above steps for each language individually.

**Note 2:** Please try to submit your localization within 7 days from the day that you claimed the localization, otherwise I'll close the issue to "free" that language for other contributers (it probably takes less than an hour to finish it!)

**Note 3:** If you can't translate a phrase, or it doesn't need localization, it is perfectly fine to leave it as it.
