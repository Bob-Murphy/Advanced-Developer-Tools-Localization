# If you're interested in contributing a translation, please follow these steps:
 1. Take a look in the issues section, and **make sure no one else has "claimed" the localization** for your language (see step 2)

 3. Create a new issue with the name: `Feature Request: <Language Name> localization` (there's an issue template you can use). This tells me and the others that you want to claim this language. So others won't work on it and there won't be a conflict.
 
 5. Download the `Stringtable.xml` file to your computer.
 
 7. Search for your language name and translate the phrase next to it according to the `Original` translation (don't use other languages, because the translations may not be accurate and thus yours will be affected too). For example, if you want to localize for German, search for `<German>` and translate all the phrases.

 9. **(Optional step)** Unpbo the mod, replace the orignal `Stringtable.xml` with your version, repack the mod folder into a new pbo and test your translation in-game.
 
 11. Once you're done, create a fork of this repository, upload the updated `Stringtable.xml` on your forked repository, and make a pull request.

**Note 1:** Please make sure you only modify **one** language in a single pull request. If you want to contribute to multiple languages, please follow the above steps for each language individually.

**Note 2:** Please try to keep the length of translations as close to the original text as possible. Too long/short texts may cause problems such as not fitting properly or causing other elements to move too much and fall out of place.

**Note 3:** Please try to submit your localization within **ten days** from the day that you claimed the localization, otherwise I'll close the issue to "free" that language for other contributers.

**Note 4:** If you can't translate a phrase, or it doesn't need translation, it is perfectly fine to leave it as is.
